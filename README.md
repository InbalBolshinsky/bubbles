## FunkyBubbles
## Objective:

The FunkyBubbles game project is an arcade game. The goal of the FunkyBubbles project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create an interactive and engaging arcade game. By implementing key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the project aims to provide a functional and enjoyable user experience, while demonstrating the ability to design, develop, and manage game components efficiently using C#. 

## Skills Learned:

- Advanced understanding of OOP concepts and practical application.
- Enhanced programming skills through building and debugging a game in C#.
- Experience in Game design - designing and managing game components (e.g., player input, object interactions, and score tracking).
- Developing algorithms to handle game logic, such as collision detection and game state management.
- Implementing basic UI for gameplay interaction.
- Gained proficiency in DB managment.

## Tools Used:

- .NET frameworks.
- SQL: Used for storing and managing game data such as user scores or game settings.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts.
- Git: Version control for managing project changes.
